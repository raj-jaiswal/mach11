# mach11

A minimal React + Vite Fake Betting multiplayer game for Rocketry And Aviation Club, IIT Patna.

---

## 1. Project Overview
`mach11` is a simple React application scaffolded with Vite. It includes basic tooling to help you start developing a small React app quickly: hot module reloading (HMR), build scripts, linting configuration, and a Vercel deployment configuration.

This README describes how to run, build, and deploy the project, and explains the repository layout so you can extend the project.

## 2. Demo / Live Preview
A demo deployment exists at:
https://mach11.vercel.app

(If the link is outdated, redeploy to Vercel or run locally to preview the current version.)

## 3. Features
- React app bootstrapped using Vite for fast development and lean production builds.
- ESLint configuration included for consistent code style and basic linting rules.
- Vercel configuration included for easy zero-config deployment.
- Minimal, opinionated starter structure to help you focus on building features.

## 4. Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS: v18+ or newer) — Vite works with Node 16+, but check `package.json` for the exact engines field if present.
- npm or yarn (examples below use npm)

## 5. Local Setup & Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raj-jaiswal/mach11.git
cd mach11
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
```

3. Start the development server (with HMR):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the URL printed by Vite (commonly http://localhost:5173) to see the app.

## 6. Available Scripts
These are standard scripts commonly found in Vite + React templates. Check `package.json` to confirm exact names and flags.

- `npm run dev` — start dev server with hot module replacement.
- `npm run build` — create an optimized production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — locally preview the production build (after `build`).
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint over the codebase (if lint script is configured).

If you add TypeScript or additional tooling, update scripts accordingly.

## 7. Project Structure
A typical layout you'll find in this repository:

```
mach11/
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.jsx         # app entry (ReactDOM + root component mount)
│  ├─ App.jsx          # root React component
│  └─ styles.css       # global styles (if present)
├─ index.html          # Vite HTML entry
├─ package.json        # scripts & dependencies
├─ vite.config.js      # Vite configuration
├─ vercel.json         # Vercel deployment config
├─ .gitignore
├─ eslint.config.js    # ESLint configuration
└─ README.md           # original short README (this file is an extended README)
```

Adjust this section to reflect files you add (routes, assets, components, tests, etc).

## 8. Deployment (Vercel)
This repo contains a `vercel.json` (for custom routing/build settings) and is already deployed at the demo URL above.

To deploy or redeploy to Vercel:
1. Install Vercel CLI or use the Vercel web dashboard.
2. Connect your GitHub account and import the `raj-jaiswal/mach11` repository (or the fork you want to deploy).
3. Use default build settings:
   - Framework: Vite / React (if Vercel auto-detects)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
4. Deploy.

If you use Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```
Follow prompts and the project will be deployed; subsequent pushes to the connected branch trigger automatic deploys.

## 9. ESLint & Code Quality
An `eslint.config.js` is included. To run linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```
If there's no `lint` script in `package.json`, add one:
```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx"
}
```
Consider adding prettier for opinionated formatting and a pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) for guaranteed checks.

## 10. Customization
- Add routes: use React Router (install `react-router-dom`) and create a `pages/` or `routes/` folder.
- Add state management: Zustand, Redux Toolkit, or Context API depending on scale.
- Add TypeScript: follow Vite’s TypeScript template or gradually migrate files.

## 11. Troubleshooting
- `npm run dev` error about Node versions: ensure Node is compatible with Vite. Use `nvm` to switch Node versions if needed.
- Port in use: Vite prompts for alternate port or use `--port` flag.
- ESLint errors on CI: either fix or adjust rules in `eslint.config.js`.

## 12. Contributing
PRs and Issues are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and rationale.
